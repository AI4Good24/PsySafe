### <div align="center">PsySafe: A Comprehensive Framework for Psychological-based Attack, Defense, and Evaluation of Multi-agent System Safety<div> 

## Introduction
**PsySafe** is a comprehensive framework dedicated to ensuring the safety of multi-agent systems. We contend that psychology plays a crucial role in the performance and, particularly, the safety of agents. Therefore, our approach involves an in-depth exploration of agents' psychology concerning the safety of multi-agent systems. We propose a methodology centered on psychological aspects, encompassing attack strategies, defense mechanisms, and evaluation techniques. Our extensive experiments have yielded some intriguing observations. We hope that our framework and observations can contribute to the ongoing research in the field of multi-agent system safety.
